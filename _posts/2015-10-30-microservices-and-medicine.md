## Microservices & Medicine
`Data Science is an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from large volumes of data in various forms, either structured or unstructured (Wikipedia)` 

Medicine is the ultimate data science. When you're sitting across a patient in an exam room, you are summarizing structured data (e.g. laboratory tests) and unstructured data (e.g. clinic notes, journal articles) into a decision that (hopefully) represents the best interpretation of all those data according to the needs of your patient. 

More than a year ago, the computer scientist and blogger, Martin Fowler, wrote a post (with his colleague James Lewis) about ["Microservices"](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html), an architectural style for breaking applications into "service" components that can operate independently.
